### Relational Databases (SQL):

1. **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):**
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
   - Structure: Organized into tables with rows and columns.
   - Schema: Predefined, requires a fixed schema.

2. **SQL (Structured Query Language):**
   - Standard language for interacting with relational databases.
   - Used for querying, updating, and managing relational databases.

3. **Cardinality:**
   - Describes the relationship between tables.
   - Types: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.

4. **Normalization:**
   - Process of organizing data to minimize redundancy.
   - Normal Forms: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.

5. **Schema Design:**
   - Defines the structure of the database.
   - Includes tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.

6. **Indexing:**
   - Improves query performance by creating indexes on columns.
   - Types: Single-column index, Composite index.

7. **Aggregate Functions:**
   - Functions that operate on a set of values and return a single value.
   - Examples: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX.

8. **Views:**
   - Virtual tables created by a query.
   - Simplify complex queries or hide data complexity.

9. **Stored Procedures:**
   - Precompiled set of one or more SQL statements.
   - Stored and executed on the database server.
   - Can accept parameters and return values.

### Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):

1. **NoSQL Database:**
   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.
   - Structure: Document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases.
   - Schema: Dynamic, allows flexible data models.

2. **NoSQL vs. SQL:**
   - NoSQL databases are schema-less and more flexible.
   - Suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

3. **CAP Theorem:**
   - Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.
   - NoSQL databases are designed based on different trade-offs.

4. **BASE:**
   - Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent.
   - Contrast to the ACID properties of relational databases.

5. **Sharding:**
   - Technique used to distribute data across multiple servers.
   - Improves scalability for handling large amounts of data.

6. **Document-Oriented Databases:**
   - Store data as documents (e.g., JSON, BSON).
   - Flexible schema, easy to scale.


Syntax And Examples for Indexing, Aggregate functions, Views, Stored Procedures


Certainly! Below are examples and syntax for indexing, aggregate functions, views, and stored procedures in the context of SQL, using a generic syntax that is generally applicable across various relational database systems.

### 1. **Indexing:**

#### Syntax:
```sql
-- Creating a single-column index
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

-- Creating a composite index
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
```

#### Example:
```sql
-- Creating an index on the 'email' column in the 'users' table
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users (email);
```

### 2. **Aggregate Functions:**

#### Syntax:
```sql
-- COUNT
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- SUM
SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- AVG
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- MIN
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- MAX
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

#### Example:
```sql
-- Count the number of users in the 'users' table
SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM users;

-- Calculate the average age of users in the 'users' table
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;
```

### 3. **Views:**

#### Syntax:
```sql
-- Creating a view
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### Example:
```sql
-- Creating a view to show active users with their email and registration date
CREATE VIEW active_users_view AS
SELECT user_id, email, registration_date
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active';
```

### 4. **Stored Procedures:**

#### Syntax:
```sql
-- Creating a stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    (IN parameter1 data_type, IN parameter2 data_type, ...)
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;
```

#### Example:
```sql
-- Creating a stored procedure to insert a new user
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE insert_user_procedure
    (IN new_username VARCHAR(255), IN new_email VARCHAR(255))
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (new_username, new_email);
END;
//
DELIMITER ;
```
